We plan on meeting weekly on Thursday, 5:15 pm - 6:15 pm, at MH 269, to read a machine learning book [Mathematical Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://tongzhang-ml.org/lt-book.html) together. 

Thanks to Jeff and Mehrdad, there are some useful materials.

[Probability in High Dimension](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/APC550.pdf) for Chapter 3

[High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf) for Chapter 2

[Modern Discrete Probability](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mdp/roch-mdp-full.pdf)
